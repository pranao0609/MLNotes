# Handling Missing Values in Data Science

Missing values are common in real-world datasets, and handling them effectively is essential for building reliable machine learning models. Here, we cover various techniques for handling missing values in both **categorical** and **numerical** data.

## 1. Understanding Missing Values

### Types of Missing Data:
- **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**: Data is missing randomly, and there’s no systematic reason.
- **Missing at Random (MAR)**: Data is missing in relation to other observed data, but not the missing data itself.
- **Not Missing at Random (NMAR)**: Data is missing in a non-random manner, often due to a specific factor.

## 2. Common Methods for Handling Missing Values

### 2.1. Deleting Missing Data

#### 2.1.1. Drop Rows with Missing Values:
- **Use when**: Missing values are rare, and deleting rows won't significantly affect the dataset.
  
```python
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
```

#### 2.1.2. Drop Columns with Missing Values:
- **Use when**: A column has too many missing values, and it’s not useful for analysis.

```python
df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
```

### 2.2. Filling Missing Data

#### 2.2.1. Filling with a Constant Value
- **Use when**: You want to fill missing values with a specific constant, such as 0 or 'Unknown' for categorical data.

```python
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # For numerical data
df.fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)  # For categorical data
```

#### 2.2.2. Forward Fill (`ffill`)
- **Use when**: You want to propagate the last valid observation forward to fill missing values.

```python
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.3. Backward Fill (`bfill`)
- **Use when**: You want to propagate the next valid observation backward to fill missing values.

```python
df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.4. Fill with Mode (Categorical Data)
- **Use when**: You want to fill missing categorical values with the most frequent category (mode).

```python
df['categorical_column'].fillna(df['categorical_column'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.5. Fill with Median (Numerical Data)
- **Use when**: You want to fill missing numerical values with the median of the column (less sensitive to outliers than the mean).

```python
df['numerical_column'].fillna(df['numerical_column'].median(), inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.6. Fill with Mean (Numerical Data)
- **Use when**: You want to fill missing numerical values with the mean of the column.

```python
df['numerical_column'].fillna(df['numerical_column'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.7. Fill with Interpolation (Numerical Data)
- **Use when**: You want to interpolate the missing values based on other values in the dataset.

```python
df['numerical_column'].interpolate(method='linear', inplace=True)
```

#### 2.2.8. Using `SimpleImputer` from Scikit-Learn
- **Use when**: You want to use a more advanced imputation technique, like mean, median, or most frequent value imputation, for both numerical and categorical data.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# For numerical data (mean/median)
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')  # Or 'median', 'most_frequent'
df['numerical_column'] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['numerical_column']])

# For categorical data (most frequent value)
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
df['categorical_column'] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['categorical_column']])
```

### 2.3. Advanced Methods

#### 2.3.1. K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation (KNN)
- **Use when**: You want to impute missing values based on similar rows (neighbors).

```python
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer

knn_imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
df_imputed = knn_imputer.fit_transform(df)
```

#### 2.3.2. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
- **Use when**: You want to use a more sophisticated approach that models the missing data using multiple variables in the dataset.

```python
from sklearn.experimental import enable_iterative_imputer
from sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer

mice_imputer = IterativeImputer(max_iter=10, random_state=0)
df_imputed = mice_imputer.fit_transform(df)
```

## 3. Choosing the Best Method for Handling Missing Values

- **For Numerical Data**:
  - If the missing data is relatively small, filling with the **mean** or **median** is common.
  - For time-series data, **forward-fill** or **backward-fill** might work well.
  - **KNN Imputation** and **MICE** are more advanced methods, useful when the relationships between variables are complex.

- **For Categorical Data**:
  - The **mode** of the column is often used for imputation.
  - **Forward-fill** and **backward-fill** can be used when categorical data has a logical order or sequence.
  - **KNN Imputation** can also be used for categorical variables if relationships with other variables exist.

## 4. Considerations

- **Impact on Model Performance**: Different imputation techniques can influence model performance. Experiment with multiple methods to find the most suitable one.
- **Avoiding Bias**: Imputation can introduce bias if not done correctly. Always analyze the patterns of missing data before deciding on an imputation method.
- **Visualize Missing Data**: Use libraries like `missingno` to visualize missing values and detect any patterns.

```python
import missingno as msno
msno.matrix(df)
```
